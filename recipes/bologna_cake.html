        <h2>Time for dessert! Who doesn't love cake? You will not regret this choice.</h2>
        <p>Who among us hasn't looked at a cake and thought, "What this thing needs is more ranch dressing, cream cheese and Bologna?"</p>
        <p>You can make it yourself using this recipe, but no, we wouldn't care for a slice. No thank you.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages Cream Cheese (8 ounce packages)</li>
            <li>1 package Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing (1 ounce packet)</li>
            <li>340 grams Oscar Mayer Bologna</li>
            <li>1 can 8 Oz. Sharp Cheddar Aerosol Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Sprig of Cilantro or Pimento Stuffed Olive, for garnish</li>
            <li>1 package Buttery Crackers, like Ritz</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix ranch dressing into softened cream cheese, set aside.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of bologna on a plate, spread one Tablespoon or so of cream cheese on top of the slice, just like a cake, then add the second slice of bologna. Continue until all the slices are used. Then use the remainder of the cream cheese to finish "frosting" the cake. When finished frosting the "cake" squirt some of the aerosol cheese around the base and top of the cake to decorate it. Finish off with a sprig of cilantro on top or some pimento stuffed olives or … Let your imagination go.</li>
            <li>Cut into the "cake" and place a small wedge on a buttery cracker to serve. And watch the adults swarm around the "cake" and enjoy. This would be fun for a kid’s party as well.</li>
