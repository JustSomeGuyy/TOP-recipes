# odin-recipes
A "The Odin Project" assignment 1 for HTML &amp; CSS

My name is Tyler, I have always been learning and trying to get somewhere in life. I took a 80 hour course on Skill Share and I fell quite in love with coding and web development so I am working towards that for my future.

Here is my iteration on the Recipes project, hopefully you like the laugh and craziness is enjoyable. Can't wait to complete the entire road map!
